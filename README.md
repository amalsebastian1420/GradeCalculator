Elevate Labs Task 3
# 📝 Grade Calculator Program

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of the **Python Developer Internship (Task 3: Conditional Statements & Logical Flow)** under the Ministry of MSME, Govt. of India.  
The goal is to build a **decision-based business logic program** in Python that calculates grades based on user input marks using conditional statements, logical operators, and nested conditions.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **PyCharm / VS Code**
- **GitHub** (for submission)

## 🚀 Features
- Accepts marks input from the user.
- Validates input (marks must be between 0 and 100).
- Uses **if-elif-else** statements to assign grades.
- Demonstrates **logical operators** (`and`, `or`) for validation.
- Includes **nested conditions** to simulate business rules.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully (negative marks, marks > 100, non-integer values).
- Provides clear output messages for each grade.
